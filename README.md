# 📦 Task-7 – Get Basic Sales Summary from a Tiny SQLite Database using Python

## 📊 Sales Data Analysis with Python & SQLite

This project demonstrates how to use **Python**, **SQLite**, **SQL queries**, and **Matplotlib** to analyze and visualize sales data directly from a database.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

- Created a **SQLite database** with a `sales` table  
- Inserted **sample sales data** (products, quantity, price)  
- Ran SQL queries inside Python to get:
  - ✅ Total quantity sold
  - ✅ Total revenue
  - ✅ Revenue by product
- Visualized results using **Matplotlib bar chart**
- Displayed summary in a neat table using **pandas**


---

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- SQLite (with `sqlite3` module)  
- SQL (`GROUP BY`, `SUM`)  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  

---

## 📑 Steps Performed in the Notebook

- Connected to SQLite database using Python
  
- Executed SQL query to fetch product-wise total quantity and revenue
  
-Loaded SQL result into pandas

-Plotted a bar chart using matplotlib

💡 What I Learnt
-Connecting Python with SQLite databases

-Writing and running SQL queries inside Python

-Performing aggregation with GROUP BY

-Using pandas for tabular data handling

-Creating simple bar charts with matplotlib
